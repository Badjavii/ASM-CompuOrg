# Linux Command Line Interface

Linux is a free and open-source operating system, the kernel of which was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

Torvalds specifically created the Linux kernel, which is the heart of the operating system. This kernel provides communication between hardware and software. However, Linux is not a complete operating system on its own; it combines with tools and utilities developed by the GNU project and other components to form what are known as *GNU/Linux distributions*.

Linux has spawned numerous distributions tailored to different needs, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Android, which are used on servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, and personal computers.

Despite the differences between distributions, such as package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`) or window managers (e.g., GNOME, KDE), they all share the same Linux kernel at their core. This means that the basic command interface remains consistent across distributions, allowing users to utilize common commands regardless of the distribution they are using.

### Note

A command interface operates in the background to support the functions of a graphical user interface. The use of a command interface involves: 

- Open a command interface. 
- Identify your objective (for example, display directories). 
- Use the commands that you need to complete your objective (ls).
