# MSDOS Command Interface

MSDOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) was an operating system designed by Bill Gates (using a DOS standard version) for the IBM PC.

MSDOS is currently used as the default command interface for Windows. Is better know as `cmd`.

`
A command interface operates in the background to support the functions of a graphical user interface. The use of a command interface involves: 

- Open a command interface (as cmd). 
- Identify your objective (for example, navigating directories). 
- Use the commands that you need to complete your objective (cd).
