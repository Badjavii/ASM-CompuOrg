# MSDOS Command Interface

MSDOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) was an operating system designed by Bill Gates (using a DOS standard version) for the IBM PC.

MSDOS is currently used as the default command interface for Windows. Is better know as `cmd`.

### Note

A command interface operates in the background to support the functions of a graphical user interface. The use of a command interface involves: 

- Open a command interface (as cmd). 
- Identify your objective (for example, navigating directories). 
- Use the commands that you need to complete your objective (cd).

## MSDOS Command Guide

This guide is based on an online PDF document that shows each command and its usage. The commands are listed in alphabetical order.

- `ASSOC*`: Displays or modifies file extension associations.
- `AT`: Schedules commands and programs to run on a computer. This is deprecated; schtask.exe is recommended instead
- `ATTRIB`: Displays or changes file attributes.
- `BREAK*`: Sets or removes extended Ctrl+C checking on MS-DOS systems. This command is no longer used. It is included to preserve compatibility with existing MS-DOS files, but has no effect on the command line because the functionality is automatic.
- `CALCS`: Displays or modifies file access control lists (ACLs).
- `CALL`: Calls one batch program from another.
- `CD`: Displays the name of the current directory or changes to another directory.
- `CHCP`: Displays or sets the active code page number.
- `CHDIR`: Displays the name of the current directory or changes to another directory.
- `CHKDSK`: Checks a disk and displays a report of its status.
