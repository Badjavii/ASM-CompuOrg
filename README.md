## About Computer Organization

Computer organization refers to the structure and behavior of the physical components of a computer. This includes basic hardware such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. In this section, we explore how these components interact with each other and how they are managed to perform computational tasks.

## About Operating Systems

The Operating System is the interface that communicates hardware with software applications. In this section, we go deeper into how an operating system is built, covering its operation and fields.

## About Assembly Language 

Assembly is a programming language used to program microprocessors. Assembly is the most direct representation of machine language. In this section, we learn about Assembly syntax, how to write and debug programs in this language, and its application in systems programming.
